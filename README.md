#Order Up

###Drinks Ordering app Code Test for FanDuel

A small app where you can select the pub you wish to visit and select drinks from the pub's menu,
adding them to your 'round'.  Your round displays what drinks you have ordered with a total price,
you can start the round again by pressing the 'Start Again' button, or by switching to another pub.

Made using JavaScript and React, with some UI testing using Enzyme, Chai and Mocha.

```npm install``` should be done within the app and inside the client folder.

```npm test``` will run all test files ending in .spec.js

Slight bug - Drink doesn't show up in list if just adding one
